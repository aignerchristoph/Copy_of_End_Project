SELECT * FROM `categories`;

SELECT inspirations.*, userid, firstname, lastname

SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE userid = 1000; 
----------

SELECT * FROM inspirations WHERE fk_categ_name = 'kitchen';
----------

5) pinpage show several categories based on active filter buton ?

SELECT * FROM inspirations WHERE fk_categ_name = 'kitchen' OR fk_categ_name = 'bath' ORDER BY fk_categ_name;
